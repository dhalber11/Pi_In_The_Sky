## Project Proposal
### Criteria
Survivability: the payload (RPi Pico, sensors, etc) must survive and function post-flight.
Custom circuit board: breadboards are for prototyping, not for finished products.  Solder headers onto your board so everything is compact but you can add/remove the Pico and other sensors.
Data collection: your payload must collect data throughout the flight and save that data to the Picoâ€™s onboard storage. Examples: spin rate (MPU6050), altitude (MPL3115A2), location (GPS).
Data presentation: Show off the data you collected! Plot the data in some way that is meaningful to your project.
