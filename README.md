## Project Proposal
### Criteria
* Survivability: the payload (RPi Pico, sensors, etc) must survive and function post-flight.
* Custom circuit board: breadboards are for prototyping, not for finished products.  Solder headers onto your board so everything is compact but you can add/remove the Pico and other sensors.
* Data collection: your payload must collect data throughout the flight and save that data to the Picoâ€™s onboard storage. Examples: spin rate (MPU6050), altitude (MPL3115A2), location (GPS).
* Data presentation: Show off the data you collected! Plot the data in some way that is meaningful to your project.
### Overview
For this assignment we are given a very broad range of possibilities. The criteria above are the only set rules for this project. Seeing the projects name, we had the idea of designing, building, and flying a glider that met the criteria. We originally came up with two different possibilities for launching the glider that we proposed. The first was to design and build a rail launching system using bands or some other static propulsion. The other was to drop the glider from a drone that would carry it to a higher altitude and then allow it to glide and collect data. While both are acceptable ways of launching a plane they have their differences. The one thing that would stay the same would be the glider. While both options have their challenges they are both viable options for collecting data.

### Materials
* Purchased Glider? (Foam/Balsa)
* Pico
* Laser cut balsa
* Big rubber bands
* Wires
* Solder
* MPU 
* Screws
* Wax paper/covering for frame

##### This is a possible testing glider



### Objectives
These objectives mainly encompass the values that we want to track during our flight. 
Those are: 
* Tracking Altitude
* Tracking Hang Time

### Rail-Launched Glider 
#### Pros
* Its basically a railgun
#### Cons 
* Low start height(less distance)
* 


### Drone-Dropped Glider
#### Pros 
* Constant controllable start altitude'
* Longer flight time
* Consistency
#### Cons
* Limited weight
* Limited flying conditions
